**PYPOWER** is a power flow and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solver. It is a port of
MATPOWER_ to the Python_ programming language. Current
features include:

* DC and AC (Newton's method & Fast Decoupled) power flow and
* DC and AC optimal power flow (OPF)

Prerequisites
=============

PYPOWER depends upon these prerequisites on the level of the operating system:

* Python_ >= 3.5

Virtual Environment
===================

PYPOWER is recommended to be installed into a virtual environment::

  $ python3.12 -m venv venv  # Or any supported Python version

Dependencies
============

PYPOWER depends upon NumPy, SciPy and PyRLU which can be installed as follows::

  $ venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Installation
============

The recommended way of installing PYPOWER is using pip_::

  $ venv/bin/python -m pip install PYPOWER

Alternatively, `download <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PYPOWER#downloads>`_ and
unpack the tarball and install::

  $ tar zxf PYPOWER-5.x.y.tar.gz
  $ venv/bin/python setup.py install

Testing
=======

PYPOWER can be tested locally using the same tooling as on Travis CI::

  $ venv/bin/python -m tox -e 3.10,3.11,3.12  # Or any supported Python version

Case Testing
============

The cases in the `pypower` folder can also be tested locally using the command:

~~~
python3.x -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -m pip --upgrade -r requirements.txt
python3 tests/test_cases.py
~~~

where `x` is one of the supported python minor version numbers.

**Note**: this test first runs the tox tests in all the supported environment.

Using PYPOWER
=============

Installing PYPOWER creates ``pf`` and ``opf`` commands. To list the command
options::

  $ venv/bin/pf -h

or::

  $ venv/bin/opf -h

PYPOWER includes a selection of test cases. For example, to run a power flow
on the IEEE 14 bus test case::

  $ venv/bin/pf -c case14

Alternatively, the path to a PYPOWER case data file can be specified::

  $ venv/bin/pf /path/to/case14.py

The ``opf`` command has the same calling syntax. For example, to solve an OPF
for the IEEE Reliability Test System and write the solved case to file::

  $ venv/bin/opf -c case24_ieee_rts --solvedcase=rtsout.py

For further information please refer to https://rwl.github.io/PYPOWER/ and the
`API documentation`_.
